- make a sprint board for this

I want to select whether I see the output on the standard out or not V
I want to see in logs whether it was scheduled run or not
Perhaps add the command functions to a seperate lib V
A lock file that prevents writing to the same file twice
Better dealing with yaml files (their locations specifically)
Check the naming in the test yaml, it can't contain spaces! So reformat that to lowercase with -!
